## Installing Required Packages

```{r install packages}
install.packages("tidyverse") #data importing
install.packages("lubridate") #date functions
install.packages("ggplot2") # visualizations

```

```{r wrangling the data}

library(tidyverse) #helps wrangle data
library(lubridate) #helps wrangle data
library(ggplot2) #helps with visualization
getwd() #displays your working directory
setwd("C:/Users/cmfoo/OneDrive/Documents/Google")

```

## Step 1: Collect the Data

```{r uploading files}

#Upload datasets(csv files here)

q2_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.csv")
q3_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.csv")
q4_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.csv")
q1_2020 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")

```

## Step 2: Wrangle Data and Combine into a Single File

```{r Wrangling and Combining Data}

colnames(q2_2019)
colnames(q3_2019)
colnames(q4_2019)

```{r combining data frames into one big data frame}

all_trips <- bind_rows(q2_2019, q3_2019, q4_2019, q1_2020)

```

```

## Clean Up and Add Data to Prepare for Analysis

```{r checking the new table}

colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  Also tail(all_trips)
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

```

```{r fixing all_trips table}
table(all_trips$member_casual) #seeing how many observations fall under each usertype

#1
all_trips <- all_trips %>% 
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual 
                                ,"Subscriber" = 'member' 
                                ,"Customer" = 'casual'))

table(all_trips$member_casual)

#2 - Add columns that list the date, month, and year for each ride
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at)  #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day   <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year  <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date),"%A")

#3 - Adding "ride_length" calculation
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)
# Inspect the structure of the columns
str(all_trips)
# Convert "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)


#4 - Delete bad data
# The data frame includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative
# We will create a new version of the data frame (v2) since data is being removed
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length<0),]

```

##Step 4: Conducting descriptive analysis

```{r descriptive analysis}

# Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)

median(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
max(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #longest ride
min(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #shortest ride

# You can condense the four lines above to one line using summary() on the specific attribute
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)

# Compare members and casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)

# See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

# Notice that the days of the week are out of order. Let's fix that.
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

# Now, let's run the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)


# analyze ridership data by type and weekday
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% #calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) # sorts data

```

```{r visualizing the data}

# Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%

```

```{r exporting data}

counts <- aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
